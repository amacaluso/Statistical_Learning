If we drop the assumption of homoscedasticity of the groups, a discriminant analysis approach produce a discriminant function which is quadratic and, in turn, also the separation surface is no longer linear.


Despite using a more complex separation surface, this model achieves worse performances than the LDA, with accuracy and AUC of 0.7322 and 0.8055 respectively.
